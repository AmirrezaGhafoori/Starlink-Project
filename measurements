Measurement platform: 

1- Multiple laptops, smartphones, power supplies
2- Cloud and edge servers in various geographic locations 
3- Hadrware and software tools to collect lower-level cellular network KPI and control plane events 
4- Availbable and custom-built "5G Killer" apps 
5- Custom built software include: -- throughput --RTT --QoE tests 

6- Synchronization and post-processing of logs from different softwares and different layers of the protocol stack 

Why Edge? --> Significant boost to throughput and RTT compared to remote cloud servers

Lord Kelvin said, “when you can measure what you are
speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know
something about it; but when you cannot measure it,
when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge
is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind” [KELVIN].
