Starlink: --> Dynamic Throughput and Latency 
	      Frequent Outage 
	      Heavily affected by environments such as terrain, solar strom, rain, cloud, and temperature so is its power consumption 
	      		
	      
Lots of simulation and theoratical work have been done 
Just a few comprehensive studies exist with deep insight into practical performance of large scale LSNs 

Systematic measurement study --> End-to-End network characteristics and performance with diverse configurations and applications 

Qs: 
1- Can today's Starlink achieve comparable performance as a typical modern terrestrial network does for end users 
2- What are the key influential factors of the Starlink network services as perceived by end users? 
3- Has Starlink achieved global coverage through its constellation? If not, what are the challenges? 


Their measurement infrastructure: 
1- 4 Dishes --> for half a year (starting from the beginning of 2022) 
2- Scripts to automate various tools and applications to communicate to servers distributed in different regions worldwide 
3- Servers distributed worldwide! 
4- Field tests in Urban and Remote wild areas --> per-region collection of over 3 million total records 

Starlink is currently using bent-pipe strategy 


They did mobility and portability support test (but with simple dishes) --> They observed the throughput does not change much but they experienced frequent outages and high latency 


Two LEO constellation network simulators: 1- Hypatia 2- StarPerf 


Their novelty as they said: More global coverage with distand endpoints, considers video streaming, remote wild northern areas, and power consumption 

At the time of their experiments there were two dishes avaiable: 1- Round-shaped Gen 1 2- Rectangular Gen 2 --> They say that the second one has better portability
but remains bulky. 

The numerical obstruction ration is visable in the "Debug Page" of the starlink app 


They have mentioned the number of GSs located worldwide using this website informaiotn (https://starlink.sx/) which is not related to spaceX
