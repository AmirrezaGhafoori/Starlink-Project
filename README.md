# Starlink-Project

We have done a measurement and comparison study on Starlink vs. Cellular networks in terms of their throughput and latency.  
In this repository, there are two PDF files that contain the detailed results and analysis of the measurements for our paper accepted in GLOBECOM 2024 titled "Stars and Towers on the Wheels: Global Perspective on Satellite Networks vs. Terrestrial 5G".

Because of the length restrictions of the conference, we've uploaded these two PDF files: 

1. **statistical_description.pdf**: This file contains the details that are mentioned in the "Network Performance" section under "Throughput Analysis" and "Latency Analysis" subsections.
2. **speed_statistical_description.pdf**: This file contains the details that are mentioned in the "Network Performance" section under the "Mobility Analysis" subsection.

We refer the reader of the paper to see the PDF files for the complete statistical analysis and description of the network measurements.
