### You can find the measurement results for RTT, and DL/UL TCP throughput tests in this folder. 

## We have four networks (ATT, T-Mobile, Verizon, Starlink) and six server locations (Virginia, California, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo) 

Each .csv file contains the results for a network-server combination in three formats:
  1- "13_all" are the measurements that has been done on 13th of the month
  2- "1213_all" are the combination of the measurements that have been done 12th and 13th
  3- "1213_summary" are the comibned of the two days, but include the summary of the measurements which means the summary of RTT tests, and the summary of throughput tests (avg throughput over the test period)
